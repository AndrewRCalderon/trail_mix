*Pitch One: Data Driven*
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) recently released an enormous dataset after an intensive assessment of the damage caused by the Blue Water Horizon oil spill in 2010. The assessment considers the impacts on wildlife, natural resources, recreational activity, and more. The data released go as granular as levels of toxicity of various contaminants found in gametes (the reproductive organisms that precede zygote development).

I will interrogate the data to find animals commonly sold in the fish market, like yellowfin tuna, and through a series of conversations, ask whether contaminated fish from the Gulf of Mexico are making their way into the food we eat. My hypothesis is that fish contaminated by the oil spill are consumed regularly in the United States. The data will provide a point of departure to then ask regulatory important questions like: what percentage of the fish market is contaminated, where is most of that fish going, what are the contaminants and their effects of human health.

Additional datasets from NOAA include toxicity reports:

2. https://www.diver.orr.noaa.gov/deepwater-horizon-nrda-data

The story can be visualized as a map that tracks the path that the most contaminated or commonly consumed commercial fish take from the Gulf of Mexico into the United States.

Data analysis, interviews with agency officials and fisheries, scientists involved in the study, and perhaps representatives from tribes involved in data collection should take 5-6 months.

At a minimum, there is a story about the aftermath of the oil spill and its continued damage to not only a vital ecosystem, but to human beings. Cruises traverse those water. People bath in oil residues and potent dispersants. The sediment is that lines marshes, beaches, and forests are contaminated and the public should be aware.

*Pitch Two: Data Driven*
The Department of Transportation of New York City posts street assessments and street pavings ratings "annually, with a status update each month." The data is includes a numeric value from 1-10 and the date the rating was collected. I will cross-reference the assessment data with Protected Streets Listings, which detail the streets that were resurfaced or reconstructed within the last five years.

I will compare when assessments are conducted with when resurfacing or reconstruction happens. I will determine which neighborhoods were rated the lowest and ask how much street work was done on those streets in the past five years. I'll pay special attention to trends in neighborhoods designated as low-income and high traffic, particularly those in Brooklyn and the Bronx.

There are additional datasets that I can use to explore disparities in assessment and implementation, like the "New York City Truck Routes," which presumably are in the most need. I am curious to see the assessment and work status of residential areas with truck routes in low income neighborhoods.

There is also a 10-year plan for capital funding to repair New York City streets, starting in 2015. A combination of the geodata from the plan, the assessment data, and the protected streets data will elucidate what the DOT has accomplished in the two years since the plan was announced.

*Pitch Three: Topic-Driven*
A recent study from the University of Nottingham reports that cigarette butts can hold far more carbon than previously assumed. When processed under high temperatures, the butts can serve as hydrogen storage units, and perhaps eventually, fuel sources. The wrinkle is that in the three years since the initial finding that used cigarettes can act like storage units, no green tech company has publicly taken on the challenge of commodifying the waste for energy storage. There are roughly 4.5 trillion cigarette butts discarded annually, so the potential is tremendous.

What are the obstacles to repurposing this waste product?

I will interview the the principal investigator of the study at Nottingham to learn about the potential applications and about companies currently looking into the repurposing cigarette waste for the hydrogen economy. The CDC has published data on cigarette consumption nationwide that can be cross-referenced with data from the EIA about hydrogen consumption. It'd also be interesting to review data about hydrogen vehicle sales in the United States. California is the primary market for hydrogen-powered vehicles, but as of last year, Air Liquide announced at least two hydrogen stations were coming to New York City.  

Much of the data analysis will provide background on the state of the hydrogen economy in the United States, and in the North East, specifically. That will inform my interviews and help me better understand the potential applications and marketability of cigarettes as a storage material. Scientists say the potential is huge, but whether it is a viable market product remains little discussed.

*Pitch Four: Topic-Driven*

A Journal of Environmental Psychology study from 2017 explored the characteristics and effects of place attachment, the "cognitive-emotional bond between individuals and their important settings." The researchers list 13, categories of benefits based on a qualitative analysis of interview questions. The researchers's methodology is open to the public.

With this study as context, delving into the topic of gentrification in New York City to be understand the psychology of displacement. What it feels to be forced out of a neighborhood and for those who've been displaced for a while, what their psychology state is. The story wouldn't attempt to diagnose any displaced, but rather use the study to inform the interviews. I am particularly interested in following up with residents who were displace more then five years ago, to understand how their lives changed, what was lost and gained, and what their perception of the relocation is.

The New York City Comptroller's office released a report in 2017 that highlighted the economic and labor impacts of gentrification. Economics, class tension, and race are typically the lenses used to discuss this topic. Psychology, however, seldom comes to the fore. Indeed most stories in the news fail to contextualize the phenomenon in a psychology of displacement and place attachment. That's what this story would attempt to do.

I will interview people who were forced to relocate from their neighborhoods due to rising housing costs and hear their stories to better understand how the experience affected their psychological wellbeing. What I expect to hear is that the benefits of place attachment as described in the study are no longer present, replaced by other feelings and thoughts. Resentment, perhaps? A loss of place identity?
